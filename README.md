# sean-and-moerer-project
final project

For our project we will be using pyevolve to evolve a robocode robot. We will modify the code written by Sean Lindgren for robot 'The Patriot' to run on numbers and booleans that will allow pyevolve to cause the robot to make adjustments in game.

To Run the our program:
1. Download Robocode
2. Start up robocode.
3. Create two new robots in robot editor.
4. Paste Scorer.java as the code for one robot, and paste EvolvedRobot.java as the other robot.
5. Line 42 of Scorer.java can be comented out to run program without watching the battles in robocode.
6. IN project.py Line 29 edits the parameters for the variables of the robot, line 39 sets population for generations, and line 44 sets the number of generations.
7. Run project.py in the terminal
